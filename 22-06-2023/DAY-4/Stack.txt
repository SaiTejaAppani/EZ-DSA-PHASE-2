*************************STACK***************************
This follows LIFO 

***********Stack Implementation**********
1.Using Arrays
2.Using Linked List
3.Using input module 

Note:Insertion and Deletion at one end of the stack(top)

Inserting node at last and deleting node at the last becomes stack

Method-2:
While Implementing stack using linked list we can opt this method  also
Here we do insert node at begining delete the head node or first  node

Note:In this above two methods 2nd one is efficient
     because in 1st method to do the pop method we
     have to traverse till last node

get combination of paranthesis has input and check 
whether it is balanced or not

********************************Queue*****************************
Note:Insertion and deletion happens at two sides front and rear

There are 3 converisons 
Infix
Prefix
Postfix

No two operators of same priority to stay in the stack
2.Lowest priority operator cannot be placed before highest priority opeartor in the stack
3. If anuy operator in b/w braces in the stack
