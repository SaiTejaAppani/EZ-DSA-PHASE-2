FLoys Algirithm is used to find out whether a linkedlist contain cycle or not

1.To find out the meeting point if there is a cycle assigned to pointers to head node
2.One pointer will jump 1 step another will jump 2 steps
3.If they are meeting on one node they delacre LL contains cycle that node is meeting point

Finding start node or cycle
1. Assign two pointer one with head node another one with meeting point node
2. Now both of them will jump one step at a time
3. Where they are meeting is called starting node of the cycle

Removing Cycle from Linked 
1. Find out the node which is connected with starting of the cycle and make its next has null
